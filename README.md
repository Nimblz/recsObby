# recsObby
Simple stage-based platforming game created with RECS, an Entity-Component-System library for roblox.

# Motivation
With recsObby I wanted to create a game that relied as heavily as possible on ECS for gameplay. All behaviors are defined in systems, governing a set of data components which are attached to entities. I've attempted to comment and explain my code, suchthat the project is clear and easy to understand. If there's a spot that needs commenting, please submit an issue.

This project is a work in progress.
